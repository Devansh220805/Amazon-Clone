# Amazon-Clone
A simple Amazon homepage clone built using HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript.
This project was created when I just started learning web development, right after my first calculator project.

The clone includes:

Amazon-like homepage layout

Navigation bar with search box

Slider side menu (like Amazon’s “All” menu)

Product sections and banners

🔹 This is just a front-end layout project (no backend, no database).

🔹 Created as a practice project to improve my HTML, CSS, and beginner JavaScript skills.
